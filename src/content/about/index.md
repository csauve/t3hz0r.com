You've reached my personal site, welcome! I'm Connor Sauve, but I also go by _Conscars_ and _Con_ online. I'm a software developer hailing from Victoria, Canada. I love the outdoors, travel, and anything that combines creativity and tech. I studied CSC at UVic and joined Amazon subsidiary [AbeBooks.com](https://www.abebooks.com/) in 2014. All opinions are my own.
